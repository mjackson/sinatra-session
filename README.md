**Sinatra::Session** is a small extension for [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/)
apps that provides several convenient settings and methods when working with
HTTP cookie-based sessions.

## Settings

    `session_fail`   -> A URL in your app that the client will be redirected to
                        when `session!` is called and the session is not valid.
                        Defaults to '/login'
    `session_name`   -> The name to use for the session cookie
    `session_path`   -> The session cookie path
    `session_domain` -> The session cookie domain
    `session_expire` -> The number of seconds from now the cookie will be valid
    `session_secret` -> A secret key that is used to check the integrity of
                        session data
    `session_encrypted` -> Set to `true` to use Rack::Session::EncryptedCookie.
                          Note that `session_secret` must also be a (random)
                          string > 32 chars. See below.

***Rack::Session::EncryptedCookie** is implemented through the `encrypted_cookie` gem, which provides 256-bit-AES-encrypted, tamper-proof cookies for Rack. Your `:session_secret` must be at least 32 bytes long and should be really random. Don't use a password or passphrase, generate something random. E.g. run this in a terminal and paste the output into your script:

    $ ruby -rsecurerandom -e "puts SecureRandom.hex(32)"

## Helper Methods

    `session_start!`             -> Starts the session
    `session_end!(destroy=true)` -> Ends the session. If `destroy` is false then
                                    session data will be preserved, even though
                                    future calls to `session?` will return false
    `session?`                   -> Returns true if the session is valid
    `session!`                   -> Redirects the client to the URL specified in
                                    the `session_fail` option unless the session
                                    is valid

## Installation

Via [RubyGems](http://rubygems.org):

    $ sudo gem install sinatra-session

From a local copy:

    $ git clone git://github.com/mjijackson/sinatra-session.git
    $ cd sinatra-session
    $ rake package && sudo rake install

## Usage

As with all Sinatra extensions, `Sinatra::Session` may be used in both classic
and modular-style apps. First, classic.

```ruby
require 'sinatra'
require 'sinatra/session'

set :session_fail, '/login'
set :session_secret, 'So0perSeKr3t!So0perSeKr3t!So0perSeKr3t!'
set :session_encrypted, true

get '/' do
  session!
  'Hello, ' + session[:name] + '! Click <a href="/logout">here</a> to logout.'
end

get '/login' do
  if session?
    redirect '/'
  else
    '<form method="POST" action="/login">' +
    'Please enter your name: <input type="text" name="name">' +
    '<input type="submit" value="Submit">' +
    '</form>'
  end
end

post '/login' do
  if params[:name]
    session_start!
    session[:name] = params[:name]
    redirect '/'
  else
    redirect '/login'
  end
end

get '/logout' do
  session_end!
  redirect '/'
end
```

Modular apps use very similar code but must also mixin `Sinatra::Session` via
`Sinatra#register`, like so:

```ruby
require 'sinatra/base'
require 'sinatra/session'

class MyApp < Sinatra::Base
  register Sinatra::Session

  # insert settings and routes here, same as in
  # classic example above
end
```
