Sinatra::Session
================

Sinatra::Session is a small extension for Sinatra apps that provides several
convenience settings and methods when working with cookie-based sessions.

Settings
--------

  session_fail   -> A URL in your app that the client will be redirected to
                    when `session!` is called and the session is not valid.
                    Defaults to '/login'
  session_name   -> The name to use for the session cookie
  session_path   -> The session cookie path
  session_domain -> The session cookie domain
  session_expire -> The number of seconds from now the cookie will be valid
  session_secret -> A secret key that is used to check the integrity of
                    session data

Helper Methods
--------------

  session_start!             -> Starts the session
  session_end!(destroy=true) -> Ends the session. If `destroy` is false then
                                session data will be preserved, even though
                                future calls to `session?` will return false
  session?                   -> Returns true if the session is valid
  session!                   -> Redirects the client to the URL specified in
                                the `session_fail` option unless the session is
                                valid

Installation
------------

Via Rubygems:

    $ sudo gem install sinatra-session

From a local copy:

    $ git clone git://github.com/mjijackson/sinatra-session.git
    $ cd sinatra-session
    $ rake package && sudo rake install

Usage
-----

As with all Sinatra extensions, Sinatra::Session may be used in both classic
and modular-style apps. First, classic.

    set :session_fail, '/login'
    set :session_secret, 'So0perSeKr3t!'

    get '/' do
      session!
      'Hello, ' + session[:name] + '! Click <a href="/logout">here</a> to logout.'
    end

    get '/login' do
      if session?
        redirect '/'
      else
        '<form method="POST" action="/login">' +
        'Please enter your name: <input type="text" name="name">' +
        '<input type="submit" value="Submit">' +
        '</form>'
      end
    end

    post '/login' do
      if params[:name]
        session_start!
        session[:name] = params[:name]
        redirect '/'
      else
        redirect '/login'
      end
    end

    get '/logout' do
      session_end!
      redirect '/'
    end

Modular apps use very similar code but must also mixin Sinatra::Session via
Sinatra#register, like so:

    require 'sinatra/base'
    require 'sinatra/session'

    class MyApp < Sinatra::Base
      register Sinatra::Session

      # insert settings and routes here, same as in
      # classic example above
    end
